# Important points

1. Branch name should follow this format: (type)/(small-description)

   | Type        | Example                   | Commit Prefix |
   | ----------- | ------------------------- | ------------- |
   | **Feature** | feature/small-description | feat:         |
   | **Bug**     | bug/small-description     | fix:          |
   | **Hot Fix** | hotfix/small-description  | fix:          |
   | **Docs**    | docs/small-description    | docs:         |

2. Make sure to create new branch for every ticket.
3. Prefix your commit messages with `fix:`, `feat:`, or `docs:`
4. Write meaningful commit messages, will prefer if every commit also includes ticket number.
5. PR should include ticket url and proper description.

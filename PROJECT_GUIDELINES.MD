# Important points
1. Branch name should follow this format: (type)/(ticket-number)

	| Type|Example|Commit Prefix
	|----------------|--------------|-------
	  **Feature**| feature/123| feat:
	  **Bug**|bug/123| fix:
	  **Hot Fix**|hotfix/123| fix:
	  **Docs**|docs/123| docs:

2. Make sure to create new branch for every ticket.
3. Prefix your commit messages with `fix:`, `feat:`, or `docs:`
4. Write meaningful commit messages, will prefer if every commit also includes ticket number.
5. PR should include ticket url and proper description.
